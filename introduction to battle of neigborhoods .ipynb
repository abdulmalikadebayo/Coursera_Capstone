Its diversity is reflected in Toronto\u2019s ethnic neighborhoods such as Chinatown, Corso Italia, Greektown, Kensington Market, Koreatown, Little India, Little Italy, Little Jamaica, Little Portugal & Roncesvalles. In this project we will go through step by step process to make a decision on the best location to open a restaurant in toronto. We analyze the neighborhoods in Toronto to identify the most profitable area since the success of the restaurant depends on the people and ambience. Since we already know that Toronto is the finacial capital of Canada, it is a good idea to start the restaurant here, but we just need to make sure it is a profitable idea. If so, where we can place it, so it yields more profit to the owner."

Current to 2016, the Toronto census metropolitan area (CMA), of which the majority is within the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), held a population of 5,928,040, making it Canada's most populous CMA. Toronto is the fastest growing city in North America. and is the anchor of an urban agglomeration, known as the Golden Horseshoe in Southern Ontario, located on the northwestern shore of Lake Ontario.\n\n\nToronto encompasses a geographical area formerly administered by many separate municipalities. These municipalities have each developed a distinct history and identity over the years, and their names remain in common use among Torontonians. Former municipalities include East York, Etobicoke, Forest Hill, Mimico, North York, Parkdale, Scarborough, Swansea, Weston and York. Throughout the city there exist hundreds of small neighbourhoods and some larger neighbourhoods covering a few square kilometres.\n\n\nHaving such vast population and big geographical area, there also exists big competition between businesses. Therefore it became very challenging for stake holder or new business to decide which area they should start their business to get higher revenue with lowest possible competition.\n\nThis project tries to solve the above problem by suggesting to the target Audience the best localion to open new restaurants and gaining maximum profits in Toronto.\n"
